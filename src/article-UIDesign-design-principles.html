            <p class="lead">There are a lot of different principles in web design, but where did they come from exactly?</p>

        
            <p>There are many standards and principles that surround design that are used to create amazing websites. 
                When you are learning math in high school you are building off of the principles, you learned in middle school. 
                UI design is like high school math, it is building off of design principles that surround art. </p>

            <p>I think of painting and drawing as two separate disciplines, they still use the same building blocks to make something that is 
                beautiful and they have new rules and principles that help to make something beautiful. For web developers, the website is a piece 
                of art that is being created for the user to enjoy and interact with.</p>

            <h2>Emphasis</h2>
            <p>When looking at a painting your eyes aren’t looking at the entire painting. Instead, your eyes are drawn to what the artist wants you to look at.</p>

            <p>With portrait artwork, there is an emphasis on the individual that is being painted. The painting puts the individual front and center because they are 
                the focal point of the art piece. Imagine how weird it would be if there was a portrait where there the individual was off to the side with the scenery 
                being the center focus. That’s not entirely bad if you are creating scenery with people in it, but in this example, we’re trying to create a portrait. </p>

                <img src="images\articleImages\portrait.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 30%;" alt="portrait">

            <p>In the same way, designing a website, you need to understand what is the important part of the site. Be able to think about what do I want 
                the person who comes to my website to see, what do I think is most important.</p>


            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p>Using the repetition design principle is a fancy way of saying that a piece of art should stay consistent with its style and the
                 visual pieces created. If you decide that you are going to use acrylic in a Renaissance-era style, but for the last bit of the
                 painting you switch to spray paint in a modern style and different color palette the piece of art is honestly, going to look like a pile 
                 of rubbish. In the same way, with a website, if you have a consistent style that you’re using with set colors, shapes, and sizes it’s going 
                 to feel completely off if suddenly one pages looks like it’s from a different website. </p>

                 <img src="images\articleImages\Repetition.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 30%;" alt="side of builind with a outside stairs">


            <p>Applying that example to a if you're trying to create a website that is fun and happy it's just going to look out of place if all of a sudden there is a page that looks 
                like it's for a stock trading business. </p>
            
            <p>You never want to have someone that comes to your website be confused where they are if they go to another page and it's just completely different style from everything else.</p>

            <h2>Proportion</h2>
            <p>In art, proportion often refers to how realistic or stylized something looks.  A drawing of a person has to be meticulously created to ensure that 
                the structure of the entire body is to scale and accurate. It would be decently easy to tell that something might be wrong if the artist creates the 
                arms to be half the length that they would normally be in proportion to the rest of the body. In things like animation, people take proportions to the 
                extreme to exaggerate an action like getting hit.</p>

                <img src="images\articleImages\Proportion.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 30%;" alt="A drawing of a women and a desk drawing">


            <p>In the scenario of a website, we aren’t working on the anatomy of a human to make sure it looks correct in a drawing, but making sure that the elements inside of the page are 
                proportional to everything else. Intuitively it wouldn’t make any sense to have a header be smaller than the body of an article because that’s just something that people don’t do. 
                Putting more thought into it though you realize that it is the focal point before you get into the article and is proportion correctly to do this. A side panel next to an article 
                should not take up 90 percent of the page. It would be helpful to guide users to other resources, but for that page the primary focus is the article. There should be a balance 
                between both of the elements with neither of them taking up more room than is needed.</p>

            <p>An excellent resource to look into more in proportion is the golden ratio (sometimes called the Divine Proportion). If you don’t already know about it, 
                it should be on your to-do list for learning about good design! </p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p>There are multiple ways to think of contrast like shapes, sizes and colors that artists use to bring variety to the art. If there was only one color used in a painting, 
                it would become very dull. Having different colors and contrasting them brings life in to what the artist is working on.</p>
            
                <img src="images\articleImages\Contrast.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 30%;" alt="2 spiral staircases next to walls that are tan and light blue">

            <p>These same ideas go for websites. If there is no variety in color, a user could quickly find it to be visually unappealing. There is a line between creating contrast and mixing and 
                matching distinct elements that just don’t go together (refer back to the repetition principle) </p>


            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>I don’t want to claim that these principles aren’t in web design because they really are (they are just written differently to be more important to websites), 
                but I have found it helpful to think about more as art to see it from a different angle.</p>

            <p>Personally, when designing websites, I forget that designing websites is just a specific discipline of art. When I understand the building blocks of creativity, 
                it helps to understand why different principles inside of UI are so important and how to implement them even more effectively. If you’ve ever looked at a website 
                and thought it looked like it was unbalanced, it might be because it’s not following principles of art. UI design principles are abstracted from art principles and 
                refined into being more useful for web design. Examining these principles helps us understand where UI design principles came from and to get a fresh perspective on 
                things that we might already be familiar with.</p>


            <p>Going back to the first example with math, if you don’t understand how a problem in algebra it might not be because you haven’t learned enough algebra 
                yet but because you need to first understand arithmetic.</p>
