            <p class="lead">A promise is a way to process asynchronous operations. An example of when you would want to use this is if you are grabbing different 
                pieces of information from a database and you want them to all load at the same time. </p>

                <p>A simple way to think about promises is in the world when you ask a friend to promise that they will help you get something. 
                    First, you have to ask your friend if they are willing to help you (this is calling the promise or pending) then you have to wait for their response. 
                    Your friend will most likely get back to you and say that they are able or unable to help (this would be fulfilled or rejected).</p>
                <p>You might be requesting information from the database and well it's pending the database is checking if you can fulfill the tasks that you requested. 
                    If it cannot find the correct data it will reject the request, but if it can successfully find it it will be fulfilled. </p>

                <br>

                <p>To create a simple example for a promise, we can use an if else statement to represent if a file was successful uploading or not. </p>

            <pre class="language-js">
<code>//using a function is not needed but a way to show how you can use one to call a promises
function MathPromise() {
    let numberOne = 1;
    let numberTwo = 5;

    //you can either set a promise to a variable or just return it like we are here
    //here we are either passing resolve or reject when the function is being called
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (numberOne + numberTwo === 15){
            resolve ({
                message: "10 and 5 added = 15!"
            })
        } else {
            reject({
                message: "the numbers didn't equal 15 :("
            })
        }
    })
}

//this is where we check to see if it passed or not with .then or .catch
//.then means now that we have a successful request what do should the code do now
//.catch means that there was an erorr and it was rejected and the code needs to know what to do now
MathPromise().then(message => {
    console.log(message);
}).catch( failed => {
    console.log(failed.message);

})</code>
            </pre>

            <p>You can also have multiple promises and have them processed all together in a group (If you're familiar with callbacks, 
                then using promises fixes the problem of callback hell).</p>

            <pre class="language-js">
<code>//here we are using a variable for the new promise and 
const uploalNewBlogPostOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    //this is where you would want all of your aweseom code!
    resolve("upload was successful");

})

const uploadSong = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve("upload was successful");
})

const uploadVideo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("upload failed");
    // resolve("upload was successful");
})

//you can call one promise at a time like here
Promise({
    uploalNewBlogPostOne
}).then(messages => {
    console.log(messages);
  }).catch(messages => {
      console.log(messages);
  })

//you can also call more than one in the same way 
Promise.allSettled([
    uploalNewBlogPostOne,
    uploadSong,
    uploadVideo
  ]).then(messages => {
    console.log(messages);
  }).catch(messages => {
      console.log(messages);
  })</code>
            </pre>
            <br>

            <p>This is the simple syntax for creating promises. There are of course more options for now put:</p>
            <p>Promise.all()</p>
            <p>Gives an array of all the inputs from the promises if they all are resolved</p>
            <br>
            <p>Promise.allSettled()</p>
            <p> Gives an array of all the inputs from the promises regardless if they are resolved or rejected.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Promise.race()</p>
            <p>As it suggests, the race() is used for if you want to have the return as soon as the first promise has completed.</p>
            <br>

            <p>There are a few more, but from my observations these are the main ones to use.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>conclusion</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of amazing ways to use call back Loops but this is the beginning information about how do you get started. 
                A simple way that I remember how they work is to think of them as upgraded if-then statements. If it is successful, then do the following code, 
                if it fails then throw an error or try to run again.Top graded portion of a promise is how they can have multiple promises running at the same time 
                and more functionality with how they can work. There is obviously more complexity comparatively to an if else statement, but from a more simple 
                standpoint, this is how they work.</p>

            
            <p>To understand a concept fully I find it helpful to look at multiple resources and if you're interested in continuing to look more into promises I suggest looking into
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E">JavaScript Promises In 10 Minutes</a>  
                and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises ">Using Promises</a> which is where I originally learned the information from.
