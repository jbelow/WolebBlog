            <p class="lead">Trying to find the right colors for your website can be a fun experience where you try out different palettes or an 
                annoying nuisance where it feels like there's nothing that really fits. If you feel like you always get the color palette right the 
                first try then awesome! </p>


            <p>When building websites I didn't really understand what qualified for a color palette that works and even if I did find something I wouldn't know why. </p>

            <p>Even though I do have a decent knowledge regarding design I decided that I wanted to create that I could When I needed to figure out what color is I should use that could be applicable to many different scenarios.</p>

            <p>Figuring out the why is going to be the focus for today as we look into what makes not only a good color palette but one that will work for a website.</p>


            <h2>Color Theory</h2>
            <p>Before we get into asking what works for the website we have to first understand what works for the brand that the website is for. A good way to understand this would be to think about the name of a brand. For instance, If you think about Nike You think about all the things that are associated with that brand like running, fitness, and just do it. The name helps create the brand and its identity just like how the color helps to visually explain what the brand is.
            </p>
            <p>When I first thought of using Nike as an example “I thought well that's stupid because their logo is just black and white” but there's a lot more to just black and white than you might think. </p>
           
            <img src="images\articleImages\NikeLogo.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:25%;" alt="Nike logo">

            <p>In my opinion, trying to figure something I like those based on motions is a bit of a tricky thing.   when looking for different sources on Colors and 
                emotions my favorite one that I was able to find was by Allison S. Gremillion at 99 designs (If you want to look deeper into the meaning of different 
                colors I highly suggest reading the article <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design
                ">here</a>) and when looking at the emotions from black you get power, elegance, and seriousness. The emotions that 
                are connected with white in regards to Nike are minimalistic, fresh, and clean. </p>

            <p>Warm colors like red, orange, and yellow can have a warm feeling and associated be associated with happiness. </p>
            

            <p>The one problem that I have with this is that it’s never cutting and dry (like a lot of things in life but that's really no surprise). 
                These are generalizations and just like how emotions change the meaning of a color can change. Unfortunately, it's not like math where 
                1 + 1 = 2.  you have to be smart about it though because one shade of red could be easily associated with love and maybe a particular 
                person. Another shade can be associated with energy and the gym that you go to. 
            </p>
            <p>There's no one answer for what color is meant for what, when designing your website you can take these generalizations and abstract them 
                down to figure out what would work the best. 
            </p>
            <p>You can even see this in the Nike example because their logo wasn't always black and white at one time it was red and that still works 
                very well for them because red can be associated with energy and strength (As long as you're using the right type of red and not something
                 that makes people think of cute little cuddly animals).
            </p>

            <p>Practice: <br>
                Look up five different companies and list the different colors that are in their logo or on their website. Trying to figure out what emotions are linked with those colors and see how that company uses them to convey what their brand is about. 
                </p>

            <h2>My Check List</h2>
            <p>Now you hopefully have a decent color palette that you want to work with but we still need to figure out what colors are good for websites.</p>

            <p>A few things that I try to keep in mind are the following: <br>
1.  Make sure not to make text hard to read - if you have black text don't put it on a dark background, that will just make it hard for anyone to read.<br>
2. Am I starting to use too many colors - in the practice, you may have noticed that generally speaking websites aren't you using copious amount of different colors and even more so with logos. <br>
3. Are these colors hard on the eyes - I never want to blow someone's eyes out with obnoxious colors to the point where my website is just hard to look at.<br>
4. Keep it simple! -  as much as I want to make a bold statement with a host of different colors ( which can work if done right) I need to make sure that I don't go overboard with color selection. <br>
</p>

            <p>There's probably more things that you can consider when picking out colors, but this is my honest opinion for simple process to go through 
                when picking out colors. As more of a programmer than a designer I don't want to be bogged down with too many things to think about and 
                constructing a simple list puts it in a way that I can process and understand. </p>
