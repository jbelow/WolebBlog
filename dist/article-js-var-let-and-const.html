            <p class="lead">In JavaScript in comparison to other languages, you are quite limited with variable types. All the way up until 2015 
              the only variable type that was available was var. There are a few problems with it though and that's why let and const were introduced. </p>

            <br>
            <p>NOTE: for extra practice with this topic, copy and paste the code samples into your own js file. This will help with understanding 
              the different functionality and what will give you an error.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Var</h1>
            <p>First off with var, it is a variable type that is only global or function scoped.  </p>
            <pre class="language-js">
<code>// this var any be used anywhere 
var number = 12;

function newVarFunction() {

//the var word can only be used anywhere in this function
var word = "hello";

//the number var can be used in here
//this will give you the number
console.log(number);
//this will give you the word
console.log(word);
} 
newVarFunction();

//this will give you the number
console.log(number);
//this will NOT give you the word - this is not in the scope of the function 
console.log(word);</code>
            </pre>

            <br>  

            <p>This means we are able to use it regardless of where we are inside of that said function or just anywhere if you make it global. 
              As shown in the if statement, you want to contain your variables inside of for loops it's going to be a bit more difficult with a var.</p>

            <pre class="language-js">
<code>//the var i can be used inside and outside of the for loop
  for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
      console.log(i);
  }
  console.log(i)</code>
                </pre>

              <br>
              <h2>Let</h1>
                <p>It could be argued that this is fine because you're just redefining the variable anyways if you're using another for loop but 
                  this is a dangerous way of thinking. At no point in time do you want to have your variables just floating around your code because 
                  it’s more than likely than it will create problems down the road with variables interfering with one another. </p>

                <br>

                <p>This is where let becomes useful as a variable type that is a block scope. </p>

                <pre class="language-js">
<code>function NewLetFunction(){
  //just like with var, the let x is scoped to the function
  let x = 1;

  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
      console.log(i);
  }
  //this is outside of the block (the for loop) so it doesn't know what i is and you cannot call it here
  console.log(i);

  //the let x was declared inside of the NewFunction so it is inside of the scope and can be used
  console.log(x);
}
NewLetFunction();
//Neither x nor i can be called outside of the function becuase it is outside of scope for both of them
console.log(i);
console.log(x);
</code>
                  </pre>

                  <br>
                  <p>The best way to remember block scope is to think about the curly braces. Anything that is inside of  {}  is not accessible to anything outside of it. 
                    This goes with the principle of least responsibility in a way. If part of your code does not need a particular variable than they should have no access 
                    to it. </p>



                  <pre class="language-js">
<code>{
    // this let is in the scope of these curly braces {}
    let x = 5;

    //anything in the curly braces does have access
}
    //anything outside doesn't have access</code>
                  </pre>
                  <br>


                  <br>
                  <h2>Const</h1>
                  <p>Just like its brother let, const also has global, function, and block scope. Kind of like privates inside of java, 
                    the const cannot have its value reassigned hence being called const aka consistent. It's not 100% accurate though because 
                    with arrays some of the data can be altered so there are some instances where is not a true constant. It does protect it 
                    from being completely reassigned though which is what we will see in the examples.</p>

<pre class="language-js">
<code>//a const cannot be reassigned
const count = 732.64;

// this will give an error because you can't set a new value to the const count
count = 800;</code>
                    </pre>
                    <br>
                    <p>Having a const is a really great way to ensure that you can't change primitive data in your code, but as mentioned before there is a little bit altering you can do with the data. </p>

<pre class="language-js">
<code>const names = ["Gregory", "Ashley", "Alton"];

//If you want to change an elment you can
names[2] = "Bobby";

//you can also add to the array
names.push("Joshua");

//you are not able to reassign the array because it is a const
names = ["Scott", "Markus", "William"];

//if you want to remove part of the array you can still do this with splice
names.splice(index, 1);</code>
                  </pre>
                  <br>
                  
                  <P>In the example, you can see that you are able to make changes to the pieces of the array, add to the array, 
                    but you are not allowed to reassign the array. Since this shows that it's not a truly unchangeable data type it is 
                    important to remember how you are interacting with it. In short, There are added restrictions to how you can modify the data but 
                    it is still possible when using an array.</P>



                    <hr>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>There doesn’t seem to be much use left for var - which is used for global and function scope - anymore because you can just use let for global, 
                      function, and block scope on top of that now. Also, the use of const as a more consistent variable helps with ensuring that primitive data stays 
                      that way. </p>
